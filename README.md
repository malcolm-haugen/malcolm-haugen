Throughout my career, I've honed skills in leveraging data for strategic decision-making, adeptly managing project timelines, and implementing effective revenue recovery strategies.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find immense fulfillment in spending quality time with my partner and our dachshund. Together, we cherish leisurely days at the beach, exploring coastal treasures and enjoying the sunsets. Additionally, we embark on memorable road trips across California, reveling in the breathtaking views and unique experiences each journey offers. These adventures not only provide moments of relaxation but also inspire my creativity and deepen my passion for continuous learning and personal development. Whether in the professional realm or personal life, I am dedicated to embracing challenges with enthusiasm and contributing positively to every endeavor.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w1a1JMSCh-ikpdseSFMMW2JtXZydIPz6YY6iy-LAOOg/edit ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
